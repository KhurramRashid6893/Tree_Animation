# Turtle Graphics: Flower and Tree Drawings

This repository contains two Python scripts that use the Turtle graphics module to draw a colorful flower and a recursive tree. These simple yet visually engaging programs are great for learning and demonstrating basic turtle graphics and recursion in Python.

## Contents

- `flower.py`: Draws a six-petal flower with a stem using Turtle graphics.
- `tree.py`: Recursively draws a tree-like structure with branches using Turtle graphics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included by default in Python's standard library)

## How to Run

### Flower Drawing

```bash
python flower.py
````

This script will open a Turtle graphics window and draw a red flower with a yellow fill and a green stem on a white background.

### Tree Drawing

```bash
python tree.py
```

This script opens a Turtle graphics window and draws a recursive tree on a black background using green, orange, and brown colors.

## Features

* **flower.py**:

  * Draws symmetrical petals using arc-based curves.
  * Includes a green stem aligned under the flower.
* **tree.py**:

  * Implements recursion to simulate natural tree branching.
  * Includes a leaf-like circle at branch tips.
